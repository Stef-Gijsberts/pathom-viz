= Pathom Viz

Pathom viz is a set of vizualization tools to support the development and inspection of
Graph API's built with the https://github.com/wilkerlucio/pathom[Pathom] library.

== Standalone App

The standalone app is the easiest way to use Pathom Viz.

=== Building the app

If you wanna develop the app:

[source]
----
shadow-cljs watch electron-background electron-renderer
cd shells/electron
npm install
npx electron .
----

=== Creating Electron app

To package the app do the following:

[source]
----
shadow-cljs release electron-background electron-renderer
cd shells/electron
npm run pack
----

The builds will be available at the `dist` directory.

== Available tools

=== Workspaces Pathom card

If you are using Workspaces, this is a great way to try out your parser as a card.

Here is an example of using the card with a Pathom local parser:

```clojure
(ns my-workspace-cards
  (:require [nubank.workspaces.core :as ws]
            [com.wsscode.pathom.viz.workspaces :as pvw]))

(ws/defcard simple-parser-demo
  (pvw/pathom-card {::pvw/parser parser}))
```

This will provide you a codemirror editor with query tracing support, like this:

=== D3 Trace Timeline

[GIF HERE]

The tracing visualization is used by Pathom to provide an efficient way to understand
whats happening during the processing of a specific query. But the trace code is
generic and you can use it to represent any kind of timeline that follows the same
structure.

=== Fulcro Codemirror editor

If you like to embed a Pathom query editor you can use the codemirror components provided
at the `com.wsscode.pathom.viz.codemirror` namespace. The major painpoint is usually
maintaing the index updated and

=== CodeMirror pathom-mode

== Fulcro Inspect integration

The simplest way to leverage the available tools here is though
https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro-inspect[Fulcro Inspect], you can just install
the Chrome extension and it will automatically hook into a Fulcro app and run queries
against a Pathom remote.
